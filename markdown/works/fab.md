I have been interested in Digital Fabrication ever since I visited Fab Lab Kamakura in high school.

The ability to bring computational structures into the material world while maintaining the freedom provided in digital worlds is amazing and exciting.

On a more currently practical note, being able to make customized items for daily use is very nice :)

I laser engraved my laptop at FabCafe Tokyo with a few of my favorite phrases.

1. "Ich bin meine Welt."

- This is a phrase from [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ludwig_Wittgenstein) meaning "I am my World." from the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus.

1. "λ それ.そう"

- This is a combination of [Lambda Calculus](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lambda_calculus) and the phrase "それはそう".
- Lambda calculus is an idea that originates from Alonzo Church and provides another way to look at computable machines. The more popular way that computability is understood is the [Turing machine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_machine). A simplified understanding of the meaning of λx.y is to think of it as functions `f(x) = y` in math.
- "それはそう" (Translates to "That is that.") is the ultimate tautology. I personally believe it emcompasses all expressible statements and is the most minimal statement.

1. `e^iθ = cosθ + isinθ` is [Euler's formula](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Euler's_formula). It's the first mathematical equation that I worked through and derived on my own, instead of in school, so it holds a special place in my heart.
