I occasionally VJ in a VRChat club called [CAVE](https://twitter.com/CLUBCAVE_).
Their posters are very nice to look at and I'm always amazed by the graphic design work that Pinieon is doing. (He made my logo).

Here are some videos and screenshots from past CAVE events. (Cave x Zenith collab, CAVE05, CAVE07)
PC: fap0
