[Pong.js](https://github.com/Spaghet/pong.js) was one of the first projects that I worked on when I was first learning how to program.
I watched [a video](https://vimeo.com/105955605) on the internet where someone was programming a space invaders game from scratch using HTML canvas and changed the code to create pong.
