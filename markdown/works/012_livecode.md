I ocassionally do shader livecoding both competetively and for fun.
You can see the demoscene related ones on [livecode.demozoo.org](https://livecode.demozoo.org/performers/119897.html).

Some of the ones I think are worth saving I have published on [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/sp4ghet).

Below are some screenshots of ones I feel were decent enough:
