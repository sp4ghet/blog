I performed live visuals for DJ Gaku at InfiniteRave #1 in Shibuya, Tokyo which I also organized. Among the other VJs were kaiwareStyle, amagi takayosi, FMS_Cat, and sleepJam. It was a pleasure to work with these people and perform for the first time.

The main system used was built using Unity along with veda.gl. The code is published on [Github](https://github.com/sp4ghet/vj-infiniterave) The poster was designed by Itsuki Nomura.
